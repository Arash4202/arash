                <h1>Saturn</h1>
                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet in the solar system from the sun and, with an equatorial diameter of around 120,500 kilometers (9.5 times the diameter of the Earth), the second largest after Jupiter . However , at 95 Earth masses , it only has 30% of the mass of Jupiter. Because of its striking ring system , which is visible even in small telescopes , it is often called the ring planet , although ring systems have also been found on the other three gas planets .
                    Saturn has an average distance to the sun of a good 1.43 billion kilometers; its orbit runs between that of Jupiter and that of Uranus , which is further away from the sun . It is the outermost planet that is clearly visible to the naked eye and was therefore known for thousands of years before the invention of the telescope .
                    As a gas planet , Saturn has no solid surface. Its upper layers consist of around 96% hydrogen . Of all the planets in the solar system, Saturn has the lowest average density (about 0.69 g/cm³). [1] Saturn stands out from the other planets because of its distinctive, bright and long-known rings, which largely consist of chunks of water ice and rock.</p>

                <h1>Moon</h1>
                <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384400 km (238900 mi), about 30 times the planet's diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent the Sun's are the main drivers of the tides.
                    The Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>
